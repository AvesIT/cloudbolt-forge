Top-level folder for sharing CloudBolt blueprints.

These can be exported from CloudBolt from a blueprint's details page by
pressing the "Export" button. They can be imported by running
/opt/cloudbolt/api/api_samples/python_client/samples/import_resource.py on the
CloudBolt server (import from the UI is coming soon).
