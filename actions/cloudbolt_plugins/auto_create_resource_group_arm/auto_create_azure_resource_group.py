"""
A plugin which creates a resource group and applies it to all items within a deployed resource.
Put this plugin as the first build item in a blueprint containing Azure server tiers.
It's important that this plugin is run before provisioning any servers in the build sequence, in order
for those servers to be added to this resource group.

This plugin will create a resource group in Azure, by default naming it after the deployed resource. It will
then add that resource group to the order such that the servers created in the same blueprint order are
created in the new resource group.

Because resource groups are specific to an Azure account and a location, this plugin requires you to select
an environment (from the action input) to create the resource group in a given Azure resource handler
and region. The environment you select when ordering the BP must match the environment for the Azure
VMs being created. Otherwise, any following provision jobs will fail due to the resource group not being
found in the given region that the VM is being created in.
